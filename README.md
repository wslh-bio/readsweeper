## Introduction

**wslh-bio/readsweeper** is a bioinformatics pipeline that removes human reads from raw sequencing data. The pipeline ingests FASTQ files and uses Kraken2 to classify human reads and outputs unclassified (non-human) reads. It produces cleaned FASTQ files suitable for downstream  analysis and submission to public databases.

### Workflow overview

1. Classify human reads with Kraken2 and output unclassified (non-human) reads.
1. Summartize human scrubber results in report.

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline) with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.

### Prepare input samplesheet

First, prepare a samplesheet with your input data that looks as follows:

`samplesheet.csv`:

```csv
sample,fastq_1,fastq_2
SAMPLE_1,SAMPLE_1_R1.fastq.gz,SAMPLE_1_R2.fastq.gz
SAMPLE_2,SAMPLE_2_R1.fastq.gz,SAMPLE_2_R2.fastq.gz
```

Each row represents a pair of fastq files (paired-end) or a single fastq file (single-end).

Now, you can run the pipeline using:

```bash
nextflow run wslh-bio/readsweeper \
   -profile docker \
   --input samplesheet.csv \
   --outdir ./results
```

> [!WARNING]
> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/getting_started/configuration#custom-configuration-files).
